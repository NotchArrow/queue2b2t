# Usage Guide

Dependencies:
- FabricAPI
- ModMenu
- ClothConfigAPI

Using the mod:
1. Open Minecraft and set the queue join time in ModMenu.
2. Turn **autoreconnect ON** (requires an external mod).
3. Leave Minecraft open and the mod will join the queue at the specified time of day.
4. If you have the afk-leave setting enabled, you will need to go into ModMenu and set **AFK** to **NO** before you reach the end of the queue, or the mod will disconnect.
> If you do not have the afk-leave setting enabled, you will need **antiafk ON** (requires an external mod) to avoid the 2b2t afk kick or you will be disconnected from the server after a few minutes.
