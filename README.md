## 📖 Usage Guide  

### 🚀 Setting Up  
1. **Open Minecraft** and configure the queue join time in **ModMenu**.  
2. **Enable Auto-Reconnect** (requires an external mod).  
3. **Leave Minecraft open**—the mod will automatically join the queue at the specified time.  
4. If **AFK-Leave** is enabled, you *must* go into **ModMenu** and set **AFK → NO** before reaching the front of the queue, or you’ll be disconnected.  

> **Alternative:** If AFK-Leave is **disabled**, you'll need an **Anti-AFK mod** to avoid the **2b2t AFK kick**, or you'll be disconnected after a few minutes.
