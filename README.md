## 📖 Usage Guide  

### 🚀 Setting Up  
1. **Open Minecraft** and configure the queue join time in **ModMenu**.
   > Military time format. (Ex: 20 Hours and 45 minutes is 8:45 PM)
2. **Leave Minecraft Open**—the mod will automatically join the queue at the specified time. 
   > You must be outside of a world for the mod to connect to the server successfully.
3. If **AFK-Leave** is enabled, you *must* go into **ModMenu** and set **AFK → NO** before reaching the front of the queue, or you’ll be disconnected.
   > **Alternative:** If AFK-Leave is **disabled**, you'll need an **Anti-AFK mod** to avoid the **2b2t AFK kick**, or you'll be disconnected after a few minutes.
